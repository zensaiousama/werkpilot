## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the standard process for creating, reviewing, and publishing content at Werkpilot. It ensures consistent quality, timely delivery, and alignment with brand guidelines across all content types.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all content creators, proofreaders, and reviewers involved in producing:
- Blog posts and articles
- Website copy
- Social media content
- Email campaigns
- Client deliverables (translations, copy, marketing materials)
- Internal documentation

## 3. Prerequisites

Before starting content creation, ensure you have:
- [ ] Access to the content brief or client request
- [ ] Access to the Werkpilot style guide
- [ ] Access to relevant terminology glossaries
- [ ] Access to the project management tool (Airtable/Notion)
- [ ] Understanding of the target audience and language
- [ ] Confirmed deadline and word count/scope

## 4. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Brief Review (10 min)
1. Read the content brief thoroughly
2. Identify the target audience, tone, and key messages
3. Note any specific requirements (SEO keywords, CTAs, format)
4. Clarify any ambiguities with the project manager BEFORE starting

### Step 2: Research & Outline (15-30 min)
1. Research the topic using approved sources
2. Create a structured outline with:
   - H1 title
   - H2 section headers
   - Key points per section
   - CTA placement
3. For AI-assisted content: craft the prompt using the approved prompt template
4. Submit outline for approval if required by the brief

### Step 3: Draft Creation (varies)
1. Write the first draft following the outline
2. Follow the Werkpilot style guide for:
   - Tone of voice (professional yet approachable)
   - Formatting conventions
   - Brand terminology
3. Include all required elements (headers, meta description, CTAs)
4. Save draft in the designated project folder

### Step 4: Self-Review (15 min)
Before submitting for review, check:
- [ ] Spelling and grammar (use Grammarly/LanguageTool)
- [ ] Factual accuracy of all claims
- [ ] Proper formatting and heading hierarchy
- [ ] All links are valid and correct
- [ ] Images/media are properly attributed
- [ ] SEO requirements met (if applicable)
- [ ] Word count matches the brief
- [ ] Tone matches the target audience

### Step 5: Peer Review / Proofreading (varies)
1. Submit the draft for review via the project management tool
2. Reviewer checks for:
   - Language quality and readability
   - Brand voice consistency
   - Factual accuracy
   - Client-specific requirements
3. Reviewer provides feedback directly in the document
4. Address all feedback and re-submit if needed

### Step 6: Final Approval (10 min)
1. Project manager gives final sign-off
2. Content is marked as "approved" in the tracking system
3. Any final formatting adjustments are made

### Step 7: Publishing / Delivery
1. Publish content to the designated platform OR
2. Deliver to client via the agreed channel
3. Update the project status to "completed"
4. Log the deliverable in the tracking system

## 5. Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | When | Responsible | Criteria |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Outline approval | After Step 2 | Project Manager | Aligns with brief |
| Self-review | After Step 4 | Content Creator | Checklist complete |
| Peer review | After Step 5 | Proofreader/Reviewer | Quality standards met |
| Final approval | After Step 6 | Project Manager | Ready for delivery |

## 6. Escalation Paths

- **Brief unclear:** Contact the project manager within 2 hours of receiving the brief
- **Deadline at risk:** Notify the project manager at least 24 hours before deadline
- **Quality concern:** Flag to the quality lead with specific examples

- **Technical issue:** Contact IT support via Slack #support channel

## 7. Common Mistakes

- Not checking the style guide for the specific client/project
- Submitting without self-review
- Ignoring SEO requirements
