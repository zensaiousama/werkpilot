## 1. Purpose

This SOP defines the standard quality review process for all Werkpilot deliverables. It ensures that every piece of work leaving Werkpilot meets our Swiss quality standards and client expectations, whether it is content, translations, automation configurations, or client reports.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all quality reviewers, proofreaders, and team leads responsible for:
- Content quality reviews (articles, copy, social media)
- Translation quality reviews (FR, IT, DE, EN)
- Automation quality checks (AI agent outputs)
- Client deliverable sign-off
- Internal documentation review

## 3. Prerequisites

Before conducting a quality review:
- [ ] Access to the original brief/requirements
- [ ] Access to the client's style guide (if applicable)
- [ ] Access to the Werkpilot quality rubric
- [ ] Understanding of the deliverable type and target audience
- [ ] Access to the review tracking system (Airtable)
- [ ] Previous review history for this client (if available)

## 4. Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Review Preparation (5 min)
1. Read the original brief/requirements document
2. Check the client's style guide and preferences
3. Review any specific instructions from the project manager
4. Note the deadline for review completion
5. Check if there is previous reviewer feedback for this client

### Step 2: First Pass — Structural Review (10-15 min)
Check the following structural elements:
- [ ] Deliverable matches the brief requirements (scope, length, format)
- [ ] All required sections/elements are present
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is logical and consistent
- [ ] Flow and structure make sense for the audience
- [ ] CTAs are present where required
- [ ] Meta information is complete (title, description, tags)

### Step 3: Second Pass — Content Quality (15-30 min)
Evaluate content quality against these criteria:

#### Accuracy
- [ ] All facts, data, and claims are verifiable
- [ ] No outdated information
- [ ] Technical terms used correctly
- [ ] No contradictions within the content

#### Language Quality
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
- [ ] Punctuation follows standard rules
- [ ] Sentence structure is clear and varied
- [ ] No awkward phrasing or ambiguity
- [ ] Consistent use of terminology

#### Tone & Style
- [ ] Matches the client's brand voice
- [ ] Appropriate for the target audience
- [ ] Consistent throughout the piece
- [ ] Professional without being stiff
- [ ] Active voice preferred over passive

#### Readability
- [ ] Paragraphs are reasonable length (3-5 sentences max)
- [ ] Complex ideas are explained clearly
- [ ] Transitions between sections are smooth
- [ ] Jargon is minimized or explained

### Step 4: Third Pass — Technical & Formatting (5-10 min)
- [ ] Links are correct and functional
- [ ] Images have alt text and proper attribution
- [ ] Formatting is consistent (bold, italic, lists)
- [ ] No placeholder text remaining (e.g., [TODO], Lorem ipsum)
- [ ] File naming follows convention
- [ ] Proper character encoding (special characters display correctly)

### Step 5: AI-Specific Quality Checks (if applicable)
For AI-generated or AI-assisted content:
- [ ] No AI hallucinations or fabricated facts
- [ ] No repetitive phrasing patterns
- [ ] Natural language flow (not "robotic")
- [ ] Specific to the context (not generic filler)
- [ ] No leaked prompt instructions in the output
- [ ] Appropriate cultural sensitivity

### Step 6: Score & Document (5 min)
Rate the deliverable using the quality rubric:

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Accuracy | 25% | | |
| Language Quality | 25% | | |
| Tone & Style | 20% | | |
| Readability | 15% | | |
| Formatting | 10% | | |
| Brief Compliance | 5% | | |

**Weighted Score = Sum of (Weight x Score) out of 5.0**

- 4.5-5.0: Excellent — ready for delivery
- 3.5-4.4: Good — minor revisions needed
- 2.5-3.4: Acceptable — revisions required before delivery
- 1.5-2.4: Below Standard — significant rework needed
- 1.0-1.4: Unacceptable — reject and reassign

### Step 7: Provide Feedback
1. Document all issues found with specific line/section references
2. Categorize feedback as:
   - **Critical:** Must fix before delivery (errors, inaccuracies)
   - **Important:** Should fix (quality issues, style inconsistencies)
   - **Suggestion:** Nice to improve (polish, alternative phrasing)
3. Include positive feedback (what was done well)
4. Submit review via the project management tool

### Step 8: Review Resolution
1. Creator addresses all Critical and Important feedback
2. Creator responds to Suggestions with action or rationale
3. QA reviewer verifies fixes (quick re-review)
4. Mark as "approved" or request another revision cycle
5. Maximum 2 revision cycles; escalate if still not meeting standards

## 5. Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | When | Responsible | Criteria |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|
| Structural check | After Step 2 | QA Reviewer | All elements present |
| Content quality | After Step 3 | QA Reviewer | Score >= 3.5 |
| Technical check | After Step 4 | QA Reviewer | No formatting issues |
| Final approval | After Step 8 | QA Reviewer/PM | All critical items resolved |

## 6. Escalation Paths

- **Score below 2.5:** Escalate to project manager for reassignment
- **Repeated quality issues from same creator:** Flag to HR/Training for skill assessment
- **Client-sensitive content:** Require PM sign-off before delivery
- **Factual disputes:** Escalate to subject matter expert
- **Deadline conflict:** Notify PM immediately if review will delay delivery

## 7. Common Mistakes

- Skipping the brief review and missing specific client requirements
- Only checking grammar without assessing content quality
- Not documenting feedback clearly enough for the creator
- Being too lenient on recurring issues from the same creator
- Not distinguishing between critical and minor issues
- Reviewing in a rush and missing structural problems
- Not checking for AI-specific quality issues

## 8. Tools & Resources

- **Grammar/Spelling:** Grammarly, LanguageTool, Duden (DE)
- **Readability:** Hemingway App, Flesch-Kincaid tools
- **Fact-checking:** Primary sources, client-provided references
- **Project Management:** Airtable, Notion
- **Style Guides:** Werkpilot master style guide, client-specific guides
- **Quality Rubric:** [Internal link to scoring template]
